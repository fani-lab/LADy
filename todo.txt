What's the difference between train_V2 and the train files in semeval folders?
We can consider ,aspect, category as ,latent, since no where they occurre?!

Next:
- stat code and mams
- update readme for stats ...
- visualization
- skip: dataset on other domains besides restaurants
- skip: prep on the back-translated versions
- skip: refactor quality metrics as octis offers many

add category to review objects
split: stratified on category, but how about aspect term? we cannot do since term could be anything!
