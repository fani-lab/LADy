What's the difference between train_V2 and the train files in semeval folders?
We can consider ,aspect, category as ,latent, since no where they occurre?!

Next:
- stat code and mams
- update readme for stats ...

- skip: word alignment
- skip: prep on the back-translated versions
- refactor quality metrics as octis offers many

- training w/ augmentation
    - where to put the aos of back-translated version for supervised

- visualization

add category to review objects
split: stratified on category, but how about aspect term? we cannot do since term could be anything!
