The wine list is also very nice.
"Everything was wonderful , food , drinks , staff , thousands ."
I 'd recommend this place !
I've been to Casimir more than five times and I've always had a good time there.
The food is excellent and reasonably priced.
"I tried to make reservations, but the hostess didn't have my name on both occasions."
"If the weather is nice, try to get an outside table."
"Staff have been nice, but they seemed very stressed and the unisex bathroom needs to be cleaned more often."
"From the spectacular caviar to the hospitable waitress staff, I felt like a royalty and enjoyed every second."
"Considering that we were the last customers there and that it was after the closing, the waiters did not rush us at all and made us feel comfortable and relaxed."
"I highly recommend Russian caviar to anyone who wants delicious , top-quality caviar and fantastic service ."
A traditional family restaurant .
fresh ingredients and everything is made on demand.

But the service was a little slow.
The buffet had a good selection.
The food was medium or higher including some surprisingly tasty dishes .
The service was very good too.
I have a great piece of cheesecake and we had some other good cakes .
"I'd recommend Roxy's for that, but not for her food."
My son and his girlfriend wanted cheese burgers and they were huge!
"As a result, their burgers fell apart in their hands and they made such a disaster that they didn't feel like finishing them."
I had a big pastrami sandwich on a roll .
"This place is very modern but they've forgotten the most important part of a restaurant, the food."
"The last two times I ordered from here my food was so spicy I could barely eat it, and the spice took the flavor off the plate."
And Tom Kha soup was pathetic.
"If you want a good, authentic Thai, this is not the place to go."
"We went to lunch here a couple weeks ago on a Saturday, and I was impressed with the food."
"Pesto's pizza was excellent, thin-skinned pizza with a good amount of spicy Italian cheese I'd never heard of."

We had the scallops as an appetizer and they were delicious and the sauce was wonderful.
We waited in the bar and we had martinis that were fine.
I love the food .

"A good meal , a good menu , good service and a low-key atmosphere ."
"The dishes offered were unique, very tasty and fresh from lamb sausages, sardines with cookies, large, whole shrimp to the incredible pistachio ice cream (the best and freshest I've ever eaten)."
I'm glad I was introduced to this place and this is a rare jewel in New York.
The best variety and fastest delivery.
The service was excellent and the food was delicious.
"We 're very special about sushi and we 're comfortable with every choice that included: ceviche blend , crab pie , sashimi , sushi and rolls , two kinds of sake and banana tempura ."

"Thai food is good , but delivery is terrible ."
A Thai restaurant without rice for dinner?
"The food arrived 20 minutes after I called, cold and wet."
"This is a wonderful place in every way, especially the value of money."
That's a great service.
"The waiter welcomed us without delay, very kind and cordial."

We ended our great experience with a gulab jamun (desert) recommended by the waiter.

We all agreed that Mare is one of the best seafood restaurants in New York.
I ran into this big pizza place while exploring my new neighborhood.
All the pizzas are fantastic and the price is even better!

The food was mediocre at best but it was the horrible service that made me swear I'd never come back.
"Right after we paid, the waiter took the money and said, okay, you guys get out of here."
"For people who want good food and good service, Roxy is a place to avoid."
"The first time the sushi was exceptional, the second time it was a little soft."
"The blonde wood decor is very relaxing, the premium sake is excellent and the service is excellent."
Mizu is the Japanese finding in grammar.
"While their cooking is delicious, their sushi is out of this world."
Mizu is home to creative and unique rolls that are found nowhere else.
"Not only is the kitchen the best, the service has always been attentive and charming."
Warning: you may find it difficult to dine in other Japanese restaurants after a visit to Mizu !
"Thalia is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful people to serve you, but the food doesn't fit."
I ordered the smoked salmon and the roe snack and it was out of taste.

I expected something more from such an expensive menu .
The view is spectacular and the food is excellent.

It 's a big neighborhood .
This is a good pizza place with a good selection of thin-skinned pizza including the basil slice .

The hiring service is bad.
There's no pizza 33 for me!
"Doses are scarce, unattractive and drip with fat, and personally I would drink popcorn before eating another one of these."
"Sandwiches are dry, tasteless and very expensive."
"Calling the Hampton Chutney Co. place warns you that these people offer more style than substance, but in this unattractive room with useless employees there was also a lack of the first thing."
"Seriously, this place sucks."
"The atmosphere is unprecedented, the service is unparalleled and the food is magnificent."

I'm going out with friends and suddenly I'm hungry and I just want one thing... his pizza.
This little place in Williamsburg is always nice and amazing.
The pizza is delicious and the owner is one of the best in New York.
Cream cheeses are out of this world and I love that coffee!!
"Bagels are fine, but make sure you don't make any special requests!"
I ordered him a cheese sandwich with my face open and the manager basically told me to take my business elsewhere!
Don't get into anything but bagels!
Turkey burgers are scary!
The udon soup was soy sauce and water.
The sushi was horrible!
The rice was of poor quality and was so badly cooked that it was hard.

"Obviously , no one at the restaurant has any idea or experience with Japanese cuisine ."
Good quick service.
The food is excellent and cheap.
The location is perfect.

Great atmosphere and worth everything.

"The food is delicious, especially its perfectly cooked mussels in spicy tomato sauce and its crispy fries."

"The Saturday night house DJ has a very good taste in music, and besides, she accepts requests."
You can 't go wrong with this place .
Suan is a great place that I often take my friends (schools) too.
"Its good location and the fact that Hutner College is nearby and its prices are very reasonable, makes students come back to Suan again and again."
I love your Thai people.
Noodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the thing to do!
I'll be back in Suan soon!
In summer-eat out on a terrace (another great feature of suan)!!!
I can't imagine a more friendly staff working in a restaurant.
I can't imagine any better Indian food in the whole city.
"In the last three months, the chef and staff have changed and it hasn't been for the better."
The food is inconsistent now.
This is the kind of place you'd like to take all your friends to and keep a secret.
The setting is casual and romantic.
The food is excellent!

"You don't take hamburgers, no matter what the critics say."
"The rest of the minimum amount, although it's expensive by Chinatown standards, is worth it."

The downside: service is slow and they don't serve!
The food was absolutely amazing!!
The baked clam octopus we shared as snacks was the best we've ever had!!
"The lamb was so tender and full of flavor, the dessert was divine!!"
The waiter was watching.
The bar scene seems to be happening.

"Small portions for the main snack, I had salmon (I wasn't impressed) bride had chicken, it was good."
The dessert is a joke... don't bother
"Virgins or weekly clients, they're all treated the same way and you can't ask for more than that when the service is so friendly."
"The restaurant has a familiar feel, no less important in terms of portions that are huge; the calf alone could have solved the Third World famine."
"The anti-paste was excellent, especially the squid, as well as the filling pastes."
The list of wines is extensive and you can easily go through a meal of another reasonable price .

It 's not the typical New York theme restaurant .
"A fresh bar with good food , and tons of excellent beer ."
The shrimp was excellent and the pastries were abundant.
"If you venture to Manhattan Island and can't find a great Italian restaurant, drive to Corona."
The only thing more wonderful than food (which is exceptional) is the service .
The only thing the waiters don't do for you is clean your chin when you leave.
A romantic atmosphere with only 15 tables at most.
The service was very fast but a little rushed.
"The food was very good, but not what I would consider outside this world."
It's a shame the food wasn't from the same heritage.
"The special pork pasta was bad taste, as was the seafood tagliatelle."
But it wasn't the cake enamel: a tiramisu that didn't look like anything he'd ever had.
I really liked this place .
This place has the best Chinese-style ribs in town.
I also recommend rice dishes or the different congee varieties (rice drops).
It's definitely not a place to go if you want to impress someone.
"However, if you want a good meal at a good price and you don't care about the decorations, you can't beat this place."
Quick and kind service .

Thanks to Bloom for a lovely trip.

The jukebox plays everything from Italian opera to the punches.

The beef noodle soup is good too.
The service is good and the restaurant is clean.
The best Taiwanese food in New York!

The portions are small but the fact that the food was so good makes up for that.
You should eat the crab meat lasagna that's out of this world and the chocolate bread in desserts.
The staff there is very attentive and grounded.
Indian food is excellent and the service is amazing.
The owner really caters to all your needs.
The food is excellent and the prices are very reasonable.
The food here does a great service to the name (in Cantonese it's...).

This dish is my favorite and I always have it when I go there and I never get tired of it.
"Try congee and toast as a fried dough they call ow law soh, a delicious, sweet flavored bread."
Just a good taste of Chinese food at incredible prices...
Service isn't what you're here for...
Big Wong is a great place to eat and fill your stomach.

consistently good Japanese tapas .

The atmosphere is pleasant and relaxed too...
A great place to gather for food and drink...
Yakitori (BBQ meat) is also tasty.
"If you don't mind low-quality pre-cut fish, hostile staff and a sushi chef who seems miserable then this is your place."
The price and quality of the fish alone will prevent us from making a return visit.
I wasn't going to share but I feel obliged... while I was sitting at the sushi bar having dinner we watched the chef accidentally leave a piece of unagi on the floor and as he recovered it from the floor proceed to use the piece in the delivery order he was preparing.
"This place, which is only a few months old, is perhaps Queens' biggest secret."
"Fabulous decoration - makes you feel like you're in a trendy Manhattan restaurant, very good food, cheap, staff generally friendly, and if you're a Manhattanite, or spend most of your time in Manhattan, Rice Avenue will make you feel at home... very soho/town/Upper West Side minus the expensive prices and pretentious clientele... all on Roosevelt Avenue!"
We were sitting outside and the waiter poured red wine and hot tea on me and my girlfriend.
"You'd think we'd apologize or get free drinks, but we have a snobbie waiter who doesn't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us a lip when we asked him to."
"With so many good restaurants at UW, I don't need too expensive food, an absurd and arrogant service staff who doesn't recognize that they work at a glorified restaurant, a clumsy service and an administration I don't care about."
I'm relatively new to the area and I tried to pick a Bgel in 2nd and I was disappointed with the service and thought the food was overloaded and on the expensive side.
The food is good and the prices here are mediocre.
Balushi's has solid food and nice decoration at reasonable prices.
The only problem is the manager is a complete incompetent.

Although they ask the typical questions of what kind of water you'd like the service was good and generally very relaxing to eat.
The food is excellent.

There's a disadvantage if you're ordering... delivery types have an important attitude.
I've never had a guy so dramatic (a lot of sigh and sigh and whisper under the breath) that always seems disappointed with his tips.
"I love the scene first of all, the place has a nice character and a nice light, very lucky, with location."
The pizza was pretty good and huge.
"We were four years old and we got the size of our family, a vodka penny that was a tremendously giant portion -- literally a bucket of food."
"Penny pasta was pretty extra butter, creamy which means a big dig job... tasty at first but I'd say it was full of a slice of pizza and seven to count, Penny..."
Rosa comes in and I think they're doing better.
"Interesting selection, good wines, excellent service, fun decoration."

I got a quick service with a smile.
This place has left me lifeless... my new favorite restaurant upstairs.
The wine list is extensive and impressive.
"I love the atmosphere, I felt like Paris."
The muskets were fantastic and the dessert too... will definitely be back soon.
I've been coming here for years and I have nothing else to say about the services and the great staff at The Lantern.
"Over the years the host, Vittorio, and his team, have always treated me like a family... although with all the business this jewel does not so small, it is surprising that it is even able to remember a constant but not so frequent visitor."
"I 've also been surprised by the new additions in recent years: a new jazz bar , the most fantastic dining garden , the best thin-skinned pizzas , and now a lasagna menu that 's for dying (these aren 't average lasagnas)!"
I love this place !
"I have to say, I've never had a disappointing meal here."
We could have made a meal of the delicious cookies from the cookie menu.
"Luckily , we 've saved up space for salmon , seafood and crunchy duck ."
