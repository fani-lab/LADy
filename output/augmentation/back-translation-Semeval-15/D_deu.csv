I had a huge pastrami sandwich on a roll.
"It's a trend, but they forgot the most important part of a restaurant."

Warning: You may find it difficult to eat in other Japanese restaurants after visiting Mizu

Customer service is bad.
No pizza 33 for me!
"The cans are narrow, unattractive and greasy, and I personally would drink popcorn topping before I eat another one of them."
"The sandwiches are dry, tasteless and far too expensive."
"Hampton Chutney warns that these people offer more style than substance, but in this unattractive space with helpless employees, there was also a lack of first class."

I asked for an open-cheese sandwich and the manager told me to do my business elsewhere!
You should get nothing but bagels .
The turkey burgers are terrible!
The soup for the Udon was soy sauce and water.
The sushi was terrible!
The rice was of poor quality and so poorly cooked that it was heavy.
"Besides, the rice didn't have any spices, so the sushi was dirty and disgusting."

"The waiting area is pleasant, fun and usually beautiful (in the wonderful aesthetic display, not in the way it is more beautiful than I am)."
"The food is delicious, especially its cooked to perfect shells in a spicy tomato sauce and its crispy, sticky fries"
But the best thing about LS is the nighttime atmosphere that's free of BTS.
You can have a perfectly flawed Martini in a glass (that's about 2 1/2 drinks) for $8.50 (I recommend the vanilla shade mmmm!) in a big house with great music.
The DJ on Saturday night has a great musical flavor and also accepts requests.
You can't go wrong.
Suan is a great place to take my friends.
The location is good and the fact that Hutner College is nearby and the prices are very reasonable makes the students return to Suan again and again.
I love her Thai.
Shark noodles and chicken and coconut juice are a must!
I'll be back in Suan soon!
"In the summer, eat out on a terrace (another great feature of Suan)!!!"

The environment is casual and romantic.

Small portions to the main entrance I had salmon (which was not impressed) girlfriend had chicken it was good.
The dessert is a joke.
"When we call virgins or weekly friends, they're all treated the same and you can't ask for more if the service is so friendly."
The Commission has the possibility to support the Commission and it has the possibility to support the Commission to support the Commission.

It's a shame the food wasn't from the same source.
