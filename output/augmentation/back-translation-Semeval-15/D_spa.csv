"Staff have been nice, but they seemed very stressed and the unisex bathroom needs to be cleaned more often."
"From the spectacular caviar to the hospitable waitress staff, I felt like a royalty and enjoyed every second."
"Considering that we were the last customers there and that it was after the closing, the waiters did not rush us at all and made us feel comfortable and relaxed."

A traditional family-owned restaurant
fresh ingredients and everything is made on demand.
kind staff who really allows you to enjoy your food and the company you're with.
"I thought the food was excellent, particularly the salmon dish I ate."
I also ordered the mojito change that was out of this world.
"My friends settled for rice dishes, but we came back the next day to try the amount of cleaning that was good... not exceptional, but good."
"We ate in the backyard, which is worth it, because it's cool and the music is good there."

The food was good.
The place was nice and quiet.
But the service was a little slow.
The buffet had a good selection.
The food was medium or higher including some surprisingly tasty dishes
The service was very good too.
I have a great piece of cheesecake and we had some other good cakes.
"I'd recommend Roxy's for that, but not for her food."
My son and his girlfriend wanted cheese burgers and they were huge!
"As a result, their burgers fell apart in their hands and they made such a disaster that they didn't feel like finishing them."
I had a big pastrami sandwich in a roll.
"This place is very modern but they've forgotten the most important part of a restaurant, the food."
"The last two times I ordered from here my food was so spicy I could barely eat it, and the spice also moved away from the flavor of the dish."
And Tom Kha soup was pathetic.
"If you want a good, authentic Thai, this is not the place to go."
"We went to lunch here a couple weeks ago on a Saturday, and I was very impressed with the food."
"Pesto's pizza was excellent, thin-skinned pizza with a good amount of spicy Italian cheese I'd never heard of."
"The backyard is very nice, where you can see your personal lawn."
We had the lobster sandwich and it was fantastic.

We had the scallops as an appetizer and they were delicious and the sauce was wonderful.
We waited in the bar and we had martinis that were fine.
I love the food.
It's the only place you can get delicious authentic Japanese comfort food.
I've lived in New York for five years and this place has it all.
Great food good size m great menu service and a no-pretension fit
"The dishes offered were unique, very tasty and fresh from the sardines of the lamb sausages with the whole large shrimp biscuits to the incredible pistachio ice cream (the best and freshest I've ever had)."
I'm glad I was introduced to this place and this is a rare jewel in New York.
The best variety and fastest delivery
The service was excellent and the food was delicious.
We're very special about sushi and we both enjoyed each option that included: ceviche mix (special) c c crab pastries varied sashimi sushi nd rolls t two kinds of sake and the banana tempura
Definitely a great place for a good occasion or date.
Thai food is good but terrible
A Thai restaurant without rice for dinner?
"The food arrived 20 minutes after I called, cold and wet."
"This is a wonderful place in every way, especially the value of money."
That's a great service.
"The waiter welcomed us without delay, very kind and cordial."
She was very helpful in suggesting drinks and helping us order many good dishes since we knew nothing about Indian food.
The food seemed very appetizing and delicious since it came in a variety of high dishes.
We ended our great experience with a gulab jamun (desert) recommended by the waiter.
"I thanked my friend for recommending this restaurant to me, and I will definitely recommend it to others."
"The service here was excellent, the food was fantastic."

You can't go wrong with this place.
"The food is excellent and the service is fast, friendly and very professional."
Always a good crowd but never strong.
I don't want to write because I don't want my pizza place to freeze.
By far the best pizza in Manhattan.

The menu has so many fish and oysters.
"The fish was very, very fresh."
We all agreed that Mare is one of the best seafood restaurants in New York.
I ran into this big pizza place while exploring my new neighborhood.
All the pizzas are fantastic and the price is even better!
I highly recommend Sophia's pizza.
The food was mediocre at best but it was the horrible service that made me swear I'd never come back.
"Right after we paid, the waiter took the money and said, okay, you guys get out of here."
"For people who want good food and great service, Roxy is a place to avoid."
"The first time the sushi was exceptional, the second time it was a little soft."
"The blonde wood decor is very relaxing, the premium sake is excellent and the service is excellent."
Mizu is the Japanese finding in grammar.
"While their cooking is delicious, their sushi is out of this world."
Mizu is home to creative and unique rolls that are found nowhere else.
"Not only is the kitchen the best, the service has always been attentive and charming."
Warning: it can be difficult to dine in other Japanese restaurants after visiting Mizu
"Thalia is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful people to serve you, but the food doesn't fit."
I ordered the smoked salmon and the roe snack and it was out of taste.
"The appetizer was soft and small, the dessert was uninspired."
I was expecting a little more from such an expensive menu.
The view is spectacular and the food is excellent.
And also wonderful strawberry daiquiri!
authentic Taiwanese food that's cheap... what else could you ask for?
The cold appetizer dishes taste the same as I remember growing up in Taiwan.
delicious simple food in a pleasant outdoor atmosphere
friendly and attentive waiting staff
I like scalops as much as mahi mahi (in saffron risotto!).
My friend ate her chicken and potato purée.
delicious crab cakes too.
"Even if the food wasn't that good, the garden is a great place to sit outside and relax."
Large neighborhood of the community
This is a good pizza place with a good selection of thin-skinned pizza including the basil slice.
"His pants are horrible, bad, they make you vomit, shit."
The hiring service is bad.
There's no pizza 33 for me!
"Doses are scarce, unattractive and drip with fat, and personally I would drink popcorn before eating another one of these."
"Sandwiches are dry, tasteless and very expensive."
"Calling the Hampton Chutney Co. place warns you that these people offer more style than substance, but in this unattractive room with useless employees there was also a lack of the first thing."
"Seriously, this place sucks."
"The atmosphere is unprecedented, the service is unparalleled and the food is magnificent."

A great sushi experience.

Try the sushimi cucumber roll
The drinks are very good and the cakes are very tasty.
But who says Murray is something about service
The service is terrible.
This place is not worth the price.
I love the pizza 33 .
I'm going out with friends and suddenly I'm hungry and I just want one thing... his pizza.
This little place in Williamsburg is always nice and amazing.
The pizza is delicious and the owner is one of the best in New York.
Cream cheeses are out of this world and I love that coffee !
"Bagels are fine, but make sure you don't make any special requests!"
I ordered him a cheese sandwich with my face open and the manager basically told me to take my business elsewhere!
Don 't worry about anything but bagels .
Turkey burgers are scary!
The udon soup was soy sauce and water.
The sushi was horrible!
The rice was of poor quality and was so badly cooked that it was hard.
"Besides, the rice had no seasonings, so sushi was soft and disgusting."
"The fish was adequate, but cut inexperimentally."
"Obviously, no one at the restaurant has any idea or experience with Japanese cuisine."
Good service fast
The food is excellent and cheap.
The location is perfect.
"Well, this place is so ghetto, it's not even funny."
If you like the music that's made you fly and the system's not that good and you want to pay at least $100 for a bottle of Minimum then you'll love it here.
"A wonderful pizza, especially the slice of Margarita."
Great atmosphere and worth everything.
Winnie and her staff are the best team you can find serving you.
The food is reliable and the price is moderate.
"For authentic Thai food, look for nothing but shades."
Try the pad thai or try anything on the snack menu.

Brioche and lollies as party favors is a sweet and cute touch to a more memorable meal.
The place was quiet and charming.
The service was good and the food was wonderful.
I didn't try caviar but I tried its salmon and crab salad (they're all good)
It's definitely a good place for snacks and chat.
"As a retired hipster, I can say with some certainty that for the past year Lucky Strike has been the best relaxed night in town."
"The wait staff is nice, fun and mostly wonderful (in the form of wonderful aesthetic beauty, not in the way that she's more beautiful than me)."
"The food is delicious, especially its perfectly cooked mussels in spicy tomato sauce and its crispy fries"
But the best thing about LS is that the night atmosphere is deliciously BTS-free.
You can get a completely delicious Martini in a glass (which is 2 1/2 drinks) for $8.50 (I recommend vanilla shanty mmmm!) in a big home that plays great music
"The Saturday night house DJ has a very good taste in music, and besides, she accepts requests."
You can't go wrong with this place.
Suan is a great place that I often take my friends (schools) too.
"Its good location and the fact that Hutner College is nearby and its prices are very reasonable, makes students come back to Suan again and again."
I love your Thai people.
Noodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the thing to do!
I'll be back in Suan soon!
In summer-eat out on a terrace (another great feature of suan)!!!
I can't imagine a more friendly staff working in a restaurant.
I can't imagine any better Indian food in the whole city.
"In the last three months, the chef and staff have changed and it hasn't been for the better."
The food is inconsistent now.
This is the kind of place you'd like to take all your friends to and keep a secret.
The setting is casual and romantic.
The food is excellent!
"If you have the courage, try balsamic vinegar on ice cream. It's wonderful!"
You don't get hamburgers no matter what the critics say.
"The rest of the minimum amount, though very expensive by Chinatown standards, is worth it."
"The wait here is long for Dim Sum, but if you don't like sharing tables or if the typical noisy atmosphere of Dim Sum isn't your job, this is a stylish alternative (for Chinatown)."
Some tips: skip the cranberry cake and the pork toast and egg cakes
The food was exceptional.
"I chose to go with one of the specials, the lamb in red wine that was excellent."
The service was friendly and the atmosphere casual.
The restaurant is a little noisy but that's something you can overlook once you sit down and enjoy a good meal.
This little place has a nice interior decoration and affordable prices from the city.
"The pad chicken was delicious, but the pad thai was too fat."
"I've eaten at Ginger House several times, and it's always good."
The fries are great!
Finally a reliable Chinese restaurant
This place would be much better served by a group that really understands customer service

Delicious bagels especially when they come straight out of the oven.

The service is quick and friendly.

It's a perfect place to eat amazing Indian food.
"I loved the different, innovative touch the chef gives to the food."
It's also great to have dinner in a very romantic and comfortable place.
"Your bagels are fine, but they're a little overcooked, and not really a 'special' bagel experience."
Big bagels did the old fashioned thing.
The downside: service is slow and they don't serve!
The food was absolutely amazing!!
The baked clam octopus we shared as snacks was the best we've ever had!!
"The lamb was so tender and full of flavor, the dessert was divine!!"
The waiter was watching.
The bar scene seems to be happening.
"Dinner in the city center 2002 - solution price: snacks were fine, the waiter gave me a bad suggestion.. try the best Kanish potato stuff one."
Small portions for the main course I had salmon (I wasn't impressed) bride had chicken was good.
The dessert is a joke... don't bother
"Virgins or weekly clients, they're all treated the same way and you can't ask for more than that when the service is so friendly."
"The restaurant has a familiar feel, no less important in terms of portions that are huge; the calf alone could have solved the Third World famine."
"The anti-paste was excellent, especially the squid, as well as the filling pastes."
The list of wines is extensive and you can easily go through a meal of another reasonable price
"Still, any dispute over the bill was compensated by measures of pouring their own liquor that were courtesy of the house..."
A fantastic place
Lucky strike is a great place to eat.
Great food great decoration great service
"This is the perfect place to meet friends, have lunch, dinner, drink before or after the theater."
(always ask the bartender for seasonal beer !!)
A great vacation spot to meet coworkers or friends you haven't seen in a while.
I've been doing all of this at the Heartland Brewery for over 5 years and I've never been disappointed!
What a wonderful place
It's not the typical NYC themed restaurant.
A fresh bar with good food and tons of excellent beer
The shrimp was excellent and the pastries were abundant.
"If you venture to Manhattan Island and can't find a great Italian restaurant, drive to Corona."
The only thing more wonderful than food (which is exceptional) is the service
The only thing the waiters don't do for you is clean your chin when you leave.
A romantic atmosphere with only 15 tables at most.
The service was very fast but a little rushed.
"The food was very good, but not what I would consider outside this world."
It's a shame the food wasn't from the same heritage.
"The special pork pasta was bad taste, as was the seafood tagliatelle."
But it wasn't the cake enamel: a tiramisu that didn't look like anything he'd ever had.
I really liked this place.
This place has the best Chinese-style ribs in town.
I also recommend rice dishes or different congee varieties (rice drops)
It's definitely not a place to go if you want to impress someone.
"However, if you want a good meal at a good price and you don't care about the decorations you can't beat this place."
Fast and friendly service
"When you're sitting in his main dining room (which has a spectacularly high, hand-painted ceiling) you'd never know there was a world outside."
"The food is wonderful, tasty and satisfying, and the service is professional and friendly."
I can't wait for summer when they serve out in their giant yard.
I tried Suean recently and I thought it was great.
This little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you get a lot of food for your money.
The service was quick and pleasant and the food was very tasty and they had the best hot sauce to add to their meals.
Good food
A good drink
I've never eaten cheese like this.

The food is excellent and they have a good selection of wines at reasonable prices.
"While the atmosphere and atmosphere were excellent, the food and service could have been much better."

with chicken b beef and lamb dishes
"The service is nice, and he never had any trouble getting in and getting a table."
I'm going to skip the dessert.
The best Rubén sandwich of all time!
Don't miss Bloom's visit on your next trip to Manhattan.
"It was the first place we ate on our first trip to New York, and it will be the last place we'll stop when we leave the city on our next trip to New York."
Thanks to Bloom for a lovely trip.
"The food was not fresh, the sauces were soft and very oily."
The pizza was a little wet.
Ravioli was good... but I have to say everything seemed a little too expensive.
There's not enough wine in the glass either.
"However, the service was excellent... and I really liked the atmosphere."
"The food was medium... if prices were lowered a little, it would be a bigger attraction."
This place is a big deal.

The design and the environment are just as good.

"Muscles were the heaviest things I'd ever tasted, the watermelons were soft, the goat cheese salad was weird from goat cheese, the chicken penis had bones in it... it was disgusting."
The service was nice and the desert was good.
The jukebox plays everything from Italian opera to the punches.
"The food is amazing, rich pastries and fresh pizza and pasta."

Come here for the drinks
Drinks are amazing and half off until 8:00.
"Ask Usha, the best bartender in Manhattan."
My favorite was the bad girl .
This is an amazing place to try some roti rolls.
I really recommend the very simple rolls of wave (egg)
Sweet onion or onion eggs and a roti of chickpeas
"Toons has been recently renovated, so it's now a very attractive space."
The food is as good as ever.
"In an area that, sadly, lacks decent Thai food this is one of the best places."
"I was here last night, the decor is good, but the food was surprisingly excellent."
"The portions are huge, so it might be good to order three things to divide (instead of an appetizer and an appetizer per person) for two people."
The best rice and spicy soup battalions in town!
The beef noodle soup is good too.
The service is good and the restaurant is clean.
The best Taiwanese food in New York!
I've been to Rao's probably 15 times in the last 3 years and it's still getting better.
Rao's has the best service and atmosphere in New York.
My roommate and I love this place.
"We recently decided to try this place out, and to our delight, they have perfect outdoor seating since I had my Yorkie with me."
The interior was very cozy and lovely.
"The serving sizes here are huge, and sushi is good."
The staff is very accommodating.
Excellent pastels served in the middle of a clean and elegant decoration
"I got the $10 combo of 10 pieces, each piece of which was great."
The decor is very simple but comfortable.
The food was delicious but don't come here on an empty stomach.
The portions are small but the fact that the food was so good makes up for that.
You should eat the crab meat lasagna that's out of this world and the chocolate bread in desserts.
The staff there is very attentive and grounded.
Indian food is excellent and the service is amazing.
The owner really caters to all your needs.
The food is excellent and the prices are very reasonable.
The food here does a great service to the name (in Cantonese it's...).
I fell in love with egg noodles in a beef broth with toast and slices of roast pork.
This dish is my favorite and I always have it when I go there and I never get tired of it.
Try congee and donut as a fried dough they call ow law soh a delicious sweet flavored bread.
Just a good taste of Chinese food at incredible prices...
Service isn't what you're here for...
Big Wong is a great place to eat and fill your stomach.
"Whoever the jazz duo was, they were on point."
Good music great food fast service affordable prices.
Even the wine by the glass was good.
consistently good Japanese tapas
There's always good drinks and the service is pretty good.
The atmosphere is pleasant and relaxed too...
A great place to gather for food and drink...
Yakitori (BBQ meat) is also tasty.
"If you don't mind a low-quality pre-cut fish, a hostile staff and a sushi chef who looks miserable, then this is your place."
The price and quality of the fish alone will prevent us from making a return visit.
I wasn't going to share but I feel obliged... while I was sitting at the sushi bar having dinner we watched the chef accidentally leave a piece of unagi on the floor and as he recovered it from the floor proceed to use the piece in the delivery order he was preparing.
This place that's only a few months old is perhaps Queen's biggest secret.
"Fabulous decoration - makes you feel like you're in a trendy Manhattan restaurant, very good food at a low price, generally personal friendly and if you're a Manhattanite, or spend most of your time in Manhattan, Rice Avenue will make you feel at home... very soho/town/Upper West Side minus the expensive and pretentious clientele...all on Roosevelt Avenue!"
We were sitting outside and the waiter poured red wine and hot tea on me and my girlfriend.
"You'd think we'd apologize or get free drinks, but we have a snobbie waiter who doesn't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us a lip when we asked him to."
"With so many good restaurants at UW, I don't need too expensive, absurdly arrogant food, waiting staff doesn't recognize that they work in a glorified restaurant, clumsy service, and my management hat doesn't matter."
I'm relatively new to the area and I tried to pick a Bgel in 2nd and I was disappointed with the service and thought the food was overloaded and on the expensive side.
The food is good and the prices here are mediocre.
Balushi's has solid food and nice decoration at reasonable prices.
The only problem is the manager is a complete incompetent.
He's a low-level service and has no personality.
There's no excuse for such a terrible service.
I've never had 40 pieces of relatively good nigiri before.
$20 for everything you can eat sushi can't be beat.

"Most servers are very attentive, kind and quite attractive."
"The atmosphere was very relaxed and welcoming, the service was excellent, and the food was excellent!"
The food was good and the view of New York City was amazing even on a rainy day like the one I went to.
I'd recommend a table by the window.
Although they ask the typical questions of what kind of water you'd like the service was good and generally very relaxing to eat.
The food is excellent.
Personal pots are the perfect size for those hungry nights.
There's a disadvantage if you're ordering... delivery types have an important attitude.
I've never had a guy so dramatic (a lot of sigh and sigh and whisper under the breath) that always seems disappointed with his tips.
"I love the scene first of all, the place has a nice character and a nice light, very lucky, with location."
The pizza was pretty good and huge.
"We were four years old and we got the size of our family, a vodka penny that was a tremendously giant portion -- literally a bucket of food."
"Penny pasta was pretty extra butter, creamy which means a big dig job... tasty at first but I'd say it was full of a slice of pizza and seven to count, Penny..."
Rosa comes in and I think they're doing better.
"Interesting selection of good service wines, fun decoration"
"I found it on a cold night, the perfect place to warm up."
I got a quick service with a smile.
This place has left me lifeless... my new favorite restaurant upstairs.
The wine list is extensive and impressive.
"I love the atmosphere, I felt like Paris."
"The muskets were fantastic and the dessert was fantastic, and it'll definitely be back soon."
I've been coming here for years and I have nothing else to say about the services and the great staff at The Lantern.
"Over the years, host Vittorio and his team have always treated me like a family... although with all the business this jewel does not so small, it is surprising that it is even able to remember a constant but not so frequent visitor."
I've also been surprised by all the new additions in recent years: a new jazz bar the most fantastic food garden the best of the thin-skinned pizzas and now a lasagna menu that's for dying (these aren't average lasagnas)!
I love this place.
"I have to say, I've never had a disappointing meal here."
We could have made a meal of the delicious cookies from the cookie menu.
"Luckily, we saved up space for the salmon and the crispy duck."
