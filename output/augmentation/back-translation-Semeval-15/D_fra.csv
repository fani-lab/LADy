The waitress seems to be more concerned with appearance than function.
"After dinner, the principal grabbed my boyfriend, asked him, ""Where are you from... maybe you don't know how it works in the States... and finally, he almost ran away crying that needles are the only thing they survive on""."
"We gave a boost, I guess the model/maid just wanted more and complained to the manager."
"The whole facility is really unprofessional and I wish the black coffee had a good staff because despite the current one, it's a great place."
The pizza here is always good.
Salads are a delicious way to start a meal.
You should pass the squid.
The setting is charming.
The service is medium.
What a wonderful place.

I loved this place.
Excellent atmosphere delicious odor dishes and friendly service
The wine list is also very nice.

I also ordered the mojito change that was out of this world.

"We ate in the backyard, which is worth it, because it's cool and the music is good there."

The food was good.
The place was quiet and pleasant.
But the service was a little slow.
The buffet had a nice selection.
"The food was average or higher, including delicious and amazing dishes."
The service was also very good.
I had a great cheesecake and we had several other good pastries.
"I recommend Roxy for that, but not for their food."
My son and his girlfriend both wanted cheeseburgers and they were huge!
"As a result, their hamburgers collapsed in their hands and made such a mess that they didn't want to finish them."
I had a big pastrami sandwich on a roll.
"This place is really trendy but they forgot the most important part of a restaurant, the food."
"The last two times I ordered here, my food was so spicy I could barely eat it, and the spices were so far from the taste of the dish."
And the Tom Kha soup was pathetic.
"If you want a real good Thailand, this is not the place."
"We went to lunch here a few weeks ago, a Saturday, and I was very impressed with the food."

We're very special to sushi and we both took all the options that included: ceviche mix (special) crab dumplings mixed with sashimi sushi nd rolls t two kinds of sake and the tempura banana
It's a great place for a great occasion or a date.
Thai food is good but terrible
A Thai restaurant without rice for dinner?
"The food arrived 20 minutes after I called, cold and wet."
"It's a wonderful place, especially for the money."
- That's a great service.
The waitress was very kind and warm to us.

Mizu is home to creative and unique rolls that you can't find anywhere else.

Beware: it can be difficult to dine in other Japanese restaurants after a visit to Mizu
"Thalia is a great restaurant with nice people serving you, but the food doesn't match."
I ordered smoked salmon and Roe's appetizer and it was delicious.

The countercurrent service is bad.
No pizza 33 for me !

"Sandwiches are dry, tasteless and too expensive."
"Calling the Hampton Chutney Co. place warns you that these people offer more style than substance, but in this unattractive room with unnecessary employees, there was also a shortage of the former."
This is a crazy place.

I ordered an open cheese sandwich and the manager told me to go somewhere else!
Don 't take anything but bagels .
Turkey burgers are scary!
The noodle soup was soy sauce and water.
The sushi was horrible!
The rice was of poor quality and cooked so badly that it was hard.
"Besides, the rice had no packaging, so the sushi was bland and disgusting."

It's obvious that nobody in the restaurant has any idea or experience of Japanese cuisine.

"The guardian staff is nice, fun and for the most part beautiful (in the way they put the wonderful aesthetic, not in the way they look more beautiful than me-b@#$*)."
"The food is delicious, especially their perfectly cooked molds in a spicy tomato sauce and their crispy, shoe-fried fries"
But the best part about the IS is the delightfully BTS-free nighttime atmosphere.

You can't go wrong with this place.

I love their Thai people.
Noodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice!
I 'll be back in Suan soon !
"In summer, we eat out on a terrace (another great feature of the swan) !!!"
I can't imagine a more friendly staff working in a restaurant.
I can't think of a better Indian food in the whole city.
"Over the last three months, the boss and staff have changed, and it's not for the better."
The food is now inconsistent.
It's the kind of place you'd like to take all your friends and keep a secret.
The setting is laid back and romantic.
The food is delicious!

"I don't want hamburgers, no matter what the critics say."

"If you're on a Manhattan Island adventure and you can't find a good Italian restaurant, drive to Corona."

A comfortable romantic atmosphere with only 15 tables at most.
The service was very fast but a little rushed.
"The food was very good, but not what I consider out of the world."
It's a shame the food didn't come from the same source.
"The pork was tasteless, and the tagliatelle was tasteless."
But it wasn't the ice cream on the cake. It was a tiramisu that looked nothing like anything I'd ever eaten.
I really liked this place.
This place has the best Chinese-style beaches in town.
I also recommend rice dishes or the different congee varieties.

The jukebox plays everything from Italian opera to beat.

The best drummers in town over rice and spicy soup!
Beef noodle soup is good too.
The service is good and the restaurant is clean.
The best Taiwanese food in New York!
I've been to Rao's 15 times in the last three years and it's getting better.

The landlord really caters to all your needs.
The food is excellent and the prices are very reasonable.

"If you don't mind a sushi chef who seems miserable, this is your place."
The price and quality of the fish will prevent us from making a return visit.
"I didn't want to share but I feel compelled... sitting at the sushi bar eating, we watched the chef accidentally throw a piece of unagi on the floor and pick it up from the floor, proceeding to use the room in the delivery order he was preparing."
"This place that's only a few months old, is perhaps the biggest secret in Queens!"
"Awesome setting - you feel like you're in a fashionable Manhattan restaurant, very, very good cheap, usually staff-friendly food and if you're a Manhattanite, or spend most of your time in Manhattan, Rice Avenue will make you feel at home...very soho/village/Upper West Side minus the expensive prices and fancy clientele...all on Roosevelt Avenue!"
We were sitting outside and the waiter poured red wine and hot tea on me and my date.
"You might think we'd have excuses or free drinks -- instead, we have a snobby server who wouldn't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us the lip when we asked him to."
"With so many good restaurants on the UW, I don't need too expensive, absurdly arrogant food with the hotel staff who don't recognize that they work in a glorified restaurant, clumsy service and my management hat doesn't care."

The food is good and the prices here are poor.
Balouchi's has solid food and a nice décor at reasonable prices.

"Over the years, the host Vitorio and his team have always treated me like a family... although with all the work this little jewel has done, it's amazing that he can remember a regular but not so frequent visitor."
"I've also been amazed by all the new additions in recent years: a new jazz bar, the most fantastic garden eating the best th wool crust pizzas and now a lasagna menu that's dying for (it's not your average lasagna)!"
I love this place.
"I must say, I've never had a disappointing meal here."
We could have eaten some delicious candy from the candy menu.
"Fortunately, we've reserved room for sea salmon and the crocodile duck."
