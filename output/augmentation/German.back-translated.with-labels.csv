Indian-Chinese food is pretty good...,"[[0, 1]]"

I was speechless because of the terrible food,[[7]]

"Instead of preparing vegetarian food, the chef gave me a plate of stolen vegetables (minus sauce, spices, or some form of aesthetic representation).","[[6], [3, 4], [3, 4]]"

But $500 for a dinner for two that doesn't include wine?,"[[4, 5, 6]]"
The starter was really good.,[[1]]
The entrance was very good too.,[[1]]
What you're paying for is the environment and the name.,[[6]]

The surroundings are very luxurious and you see many rich men with trophy wives or only high-paid escorts.,[[1]]

You'd think they'd make it up to you with service.,[[9]]
"The service was fine, it's not what you'd expect for $500.",[[1]]
I agree that eating at Casa la femme is like no other experience!,"[[5, 6, 7]]"

I never left a restaurant like I was abused and wasted my hard earned money.,"[[4], [4]]"

"""very normal Indian food, but very well made.","[[2, 3], [2, 3]]"
"I got it 4 instead of 5 because of the price (only chicken tikka masala - no rice bread - is $25), which I would expect in a luxurious Indian restaurant, but this place doesn't feel luxurious","[[33], [33], [12, 13, 14], [36]]"
"The waiters are also trying to give you more food, like things that cost you, like they're a compliment.",[[1]]

"But when I got my predictable moderation of what Dokebi thinks is Korean fair (sometimes you have to decide if it's his only option), I got about half my kimchi before I found a random piece of salad, accompanied by a much more disgusting, mucky, clearly bad piece of fish skin.","[[29], [12, 13]]"
"My biggest concern was the health of the food that was sent to me and others, but I'm lying, and I said that as someone who's been working in restaurants since I was 15, I expect at least minimal effort from the restaurant side to change the situation.",[[8]]
"My friend, a little more aggressive and just as disgusting because she had to throw away the rest of her barely eaten meal, called back, only to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster, and that we were blacklisted from her restaurant, too.",[[22]]
"It wasn't like this restaurant had any major boasting points before, but now it's just disgusting.",[[4]]

A typical NYC pizza.,"[[3, 3, 2, 3]]"
"The crust has a great bite and a good chew, the sauce is light and has a nice acidity, the salt from the cheese is great, it enhances the taste of all the other ingredients.","[[1], [11], [23]]"
"I personally like margarita pizza better, but they're all good.","[[3, 4]]"
Probably the most romantic restaurant in town.,[[4]]
This is undoubtedly my favorite Japanese brass (which does not serve sushi) and in my opinion one of the most romantic restaurants in the city!,"[[5, 6], [5, 6]]"
"It's not just an adventure to get to this somewhat hidden place, entering the unknown wooden doors, the Zen and the intimate decoration will make you feel like you're no longer in the city.","[[11], [14, 15, 16], [22]]"
"If you want to come here, make sure your date is someone you really like, as you'll be taken to private stands where no people or food will be observed (choose the ones on the ground floor that have glass ceilings so you can see the stars in the sky!).","[[20, 21], [39, 40]]"
It's just you and your date and an occasional sweet excuse me before the waiter opens the little curtain to your booth!,[[14]]

"I chose the grilled black shark as the entry, which I absolutely ate, while someone commented that the grilled salmon dish was better.","[[3, 4, 5], [18, 19, 20]]"
The sake has been a very good celebration of the courses and has successfully brought me into the sake world.,[[1]]
"For dessert, we tried the frozen black sesame seeds (interesting but not unusual) and matcha (powdered green tea) and the blueberry cheese, which was phenomenal.","[[5, 6, 7, 8], [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 19]]"
"Maybe it was the great company (I had friends from Philadelphia who came to visit me) or the super reasonable price, but I can't say enough good about this bracery.","[[29], [29]]"
"I usually don't visit more than once, which is more than twice, but I come to Zenkichi at any time for a quiet, thoughtless and unforgettable dinner.","[[16], [16]]"
"The service leaves much to be desired, from the feeling of being able to reach the place of order to a night out.",[[1]]

This is not making sense.,[[4]]
This place has a very strange decor stairs with mirrored walls I'm surprised no one has ever broken their head or fallen off the stairs mirrored walls make you dizzy and crazy...,"[[6], [9, 10]]"

We'll be back soon and can't wait to visit in the summer to use the supplies.,[[15]]
"The servers at Flatbush Farm seem to perfect this terrible technique, to make you guilty and ashamed because you're attracting their attention.",[[1]]
Another server added to the fun and threw our supplies in front of us halfway through our appetizers (which was delicious).,"[[1], [17]]"
"The overall quality of the food was quite good, although I hear that the salmon is much better off if it doesn't cool off in front of the guest.",[[5]]
"The store has nice facilities, some attractive furniture and, as I could tell, a reasonable wine menu (I got the menu when I asked for the wine menu)","[[4], [7], [15, 16]]"
How's that cock still open?,[[2]]
Everything was fine until we had our meals .,[[7]]
I looked at the chicken once and was horrified.,[[4]]
"It was served with leather, over a bed of extremely unroasted spinach and potatoes.",[[11]]
"I took a bite from a $24 salmon and in the 17 years I've been to restaurants, I've never tasted salmon as fishy, dry, and sloppy as the one on the flatwood farms.","[[7], [7]]"
"At that point, the waitress comes and asks us if everything's okay, I was literally so shocked that I was speechless and didn't say anything, and guess what, the waitress is gone.",[[4]]
"So I switched with my boyfriend again to see if I could make some meat and spinach again, but the spinach was so badly cooked that I just couldn't bite through it.",[[20]]
"It's really getting bad here: The manager said we can't do anything about it, it's a matter of taste that she didn't like it, and I can't make it up to her.",[[6]]
"The manager came to the table and said we could do whatever we wanted, so we paid for what we enjoyed, the drinks and the snacks and left.","[[1], [22], [25]]"

"If I could give 0 stars , I 'd do it for this place .",[[13]]
"This place... God, where do I start?",[[1]]
This is a spectacular scene.,[[4]]
"But the decor seems to be the distraction, so you don't notice that you just paid $300 for a cold egg goose that took 2 bloody hours to come in!!!!","[[2], [20], [20]]"
"How this place survives the competitive West Village market in this economy, or any other, is superfluous to me.",[[2]]
Big hot dogs,"[[1, 2]]"
"Although it was often crowded, most of the time when I was here, the shallow animals always gave their food.","[[19], [15]]"
The hot dogs are top notch and the slamwich is fantastic!,"[[1, 2], [8]]"
Laughter is always worth the train ride and will make your tongue and belly very happy!,[[0]]
The only complaint is pricing - I think it would be more reasonable to pay one dollar less for each item on the menu,[[23]]
But still - great place great F-food,"[[4], [6]]"
Fabulous food - if the employee doesn't scare you off,"[[1], [7, 5]]"
"Every time we were there, the employee (not the waiters - they're fantastic - but the people who greet and sit with you) was so disgusting to us that I would never come back without the exceptional fish dishes.","[[9], [6], [37, 38]]"
"Since the BFC does not make reservations, you almost always have to wait at the bar and be abused by the main thing until you sit down, which can be an hour later!","[[1], [21, 22]]"
The fresh retro girl (with wings / Lady Edna glasses) will scream at you when you try to order a drink.,[[3]]
I'd be horrified if my staff turned away clients so early and so rude!,[[5]]
"There's another girl I can't describe, she's about 5'6"" with brown hair, who listens to your conversation and listens -- except she only hears the last part of what you said, so her unspoken opinions are often out of context and have nothing to do with what you're really talking about.",[[2]]
"Considering you're going to spend at least $60 a person, I expect better service.",[[13]]

"A word for the wise: You can't eat here and disturb the master's sense of ""turning the table"", no matter how crazy it is, or whatever.",[[12]]

To take hot dogs to the next level .,"[[2, 3]]"
"At first glance, this place seems a little expensive for a hot dog bar, but barking doesn't just get you your average hot dog.","[[15], [22, 23]]"
Here the hotdog is raised to the level of a real entry with numerous variations.,"[[2, 2], [2, 2]]"
It's a great atmosphere.,[[3]]

Poor service and poor management,"[[1], [4]]"
Don't go to this place.,[[4]]
I had a terrible experience at the Casa la femme on Saturday night.,"[[7, 8, 9]]"
The manager was rude and treated the situation very badly.,[[1]]
I can't believe an expensive New York restaurant treats its customers so disrespectfully.,[[7]]

There is no way to justify the awards it receives by hiring staff or waiting for a table.,"[[12], [14]]"

"The pasta was well cooked, not had enough sauce or flavor.","[[1], [1], [1]]"

"I asked for a menu, and the same waitress looked at me like I was crazy.",[[8]]
"I was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said, ""Can I help you?"" and ""How many people are at your party?""",[[11]]
Shame on the terrible rude staff and the lack of customer service.,"[[5], [10, 11]]"
Bad employees,[[1]]
I like this place.,[[3]]
The food is good.,[[1]]
The design of the room is good.,[[4]]
But the service is terrible!,[[2]]
I was at a brunch recently and we were accompanied by a waitress and a waiter.,"[[12], [15]]"
The waiter was delivering the food while holding a plastic bag of garbage in one hand.,[[1]]
