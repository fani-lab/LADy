The prices were great.

"Table service could have been more interesting, but as someone who also works in the service sector, I realized they were busy."
"Not interesting, but for me, Thai food has never been and will never be."
"The food was also very good, considering we tried to pick a budget (although I wish the pig's belly I ordered was a little longer, even the fat was more of an experience than melting in your mouth)."

The service is first class.
The food is not consistent now.

"The menu choices are similar, but the taste was more lacking than it seemed."
It must be for all the lovers of the world.
"The shares are huge, so it might be good to ask for three things to share (instead of one meal for each person) with two people."
The appetizers were good and the main course was too small.

And we split up some delicious samosa vegetables and Mali Teka files .
The knowledge of the chef and the utility are below average.
We were walking around the village and I just walked in here for a few drinks.
Choosing the right wine too .
Walking in and waiting at a table in a crowded bar often saves you from the noise of dinner.
I must say I didn't have a disappointing meal here.
I had a little burnt but it still tastes good with goat cheese and panchetti.
Bad food and bad service .
"If you want a regular local parsley with great food and excellent service, this is the place."
Great place to go for a drink too because they have 100 kinds of beer.
"It 's more than the required amount , and the small parts ."
"Meanwhile, the waiter continued to pour his spare champagne after we finished our bottle and enjoyed a fun rennet soup with the fried basil, for free."
The food was well prepared and the service was clean.
"But their best dish is curry-cooked Thai pies with shrimp -- a dish that will cost $23.95 in most places, but $16 here."
"The dark, moist air is a nice touch."
"My husband said the part was too small, but if my main course was good for eating, the part was good for me."
But the Thai is definitely not great -- very kind and unusual.

The staff are also communicative and valley-bound.
All you can eat is really amazing here.
"That 's a problem because we pay about 20 bucks for the dish , and we had to order five to get a decent taste ."

"Of course, this is not the place for a huge piece of fish to go over the plate (and thank God, in my opinion) but for a simple sushi, the snack is no better place in New York or anywhere else in the United States."
The menu seemed to have a wide variety of dishes for seafood lovers and interesting ways to prepare them.
The British white spots were great and the pasta was great.

And forget what you read. The atmosphere's not bad either.
"We couldn't keep up the conversation because the waitresses and waitresses were routinely intersecting and asking us to order and hinting that we were taking too much time -- amazing, we just sat down."
Sometimes I get good food and good service.

I highly recommend ordering a table by the window.

But the service was a bright flower in a garden.
We went to the grocery store three times and nobody was disappointed.
