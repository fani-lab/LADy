food was okay, nothing great.	train
i have eaten at saul, many times, the food is always consistently, outrageously good.	train
the food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny.	train
however, it's the service that leaves a bad taste in my mouth.	train
i happen to have a policy that goes along with a little bit of self-respect, which includes not letting a waiter intimidate me, i.e. make me feel bad asking for trivialities like water, or the check.	train
the wine list is interesting and has many good values.	train
chow fun was dry; pork shu mai was more than usually greasy and had to share a table with loud and rude family.	train
avoid this place	train
judging from previous posts of test this used to be a good place but not any longer.	train
saul is the best restaurant on smith street and in brooklyn.	train
the food is decent.	train
i/we will never go back to this place again.	train
service was devine, oysters where a sensual as they come, and the price can't be beat!!!	val
ive asked a cart attendant for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away.	val
went on a 3 day oyster binge, with fish bringing up the closing, and i am so glad this was the place it o trip ended, because it was so great!	val
