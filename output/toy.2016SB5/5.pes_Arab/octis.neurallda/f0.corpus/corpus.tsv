food was okay, nothing great.	train
i have eaten at saul, many times, the food is always consistently, outrageously good.	train
the food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny.	train
however, it's the service that leaves a bad taste in my mouth.	train
i happen to have a policy that goes along with a little bit of self-respect, which includes not letting a waiter intimidate me, i.e. make me feel bad asking for trivialities like water, or the check.	train
the wine list is interesting and has many good values.	train
chow fun was dry; pork shu mai was more than usually greasy and had to share a table with loud and rude family.	train
