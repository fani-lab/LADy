"The quality of the food was quite good, even though I've heard that salmon is much better when it hasn't cooled down in front of the guest.",[[4]]
"The place has good equipment, attractive furniture and, as far as I could tell, a list of reasonable wines (the menu was given to me when I asked for the wine map)","[[6], [18], [18, 15]]"
How come this palisade is still open?,[[3]]
Everything was fine until we had our meals.,[[7]]
I took a look at the chicken and was shocked.,[[6]]

"At this point, the waitress comes to ask us if everything was okay, I was literally so shocked that I became mute and didn't say anything, and guess what, the waitress walked away.",[[4]]
"So I switched with my boyfriend to see if I could still grow the meat and spinach, but the spinach was so undercooked I couldn't bite it.",[[19]]
"That's where it gets really bad: the director said, there's absolutely nothing we can do, it's a matter of taste that she didn't like, and I can't stand it.",[[7]]
"The manager came to the table and said we could do whatever we wanted, so we paid for what we liked, the drinks and appetizers and we left.","[[1], [22], [24]]"

Great food - if the staff doesn 't let you down .,"[[1], [5]]"
"Every time we went there, the staff at the house (not the waiters, they're fantastic, but the people who greet you and sit down) was so horrible to us that without the exceptional fish dishes, I would never come back.","[[12], [8, 9, 6], [33, 34]]"

The retro frizzy girl (with winged glasses / lady Edna) will yell at you if you try to order a drink.,[[3]]
I would be horrified if my staff refused clients so quickly and so harshly!,[[6]]
"There's another girl I can't describe, she's 5'6"" with brown hair, who listens to your conversation and sounds - except she only hears the last part of what you said, so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and have nothing to do with what you're really talking about.",[[2]]
"If you spend at least $60 a person, I expect better service.",[[11]]
"The food and service were good, but the master was incredibly unrecognizable and arrogant.","[[1], [3], [8]]"

"The waiters are also trying to give you more food, like things that cost you, like they're a compliment.",[[1]]

"My friend, a little more aggressive and just as disgusting because she had to throw away the rest of her barely eaten meal, called back, only to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster, and that we were blacklisted from her restaurant, too.",[[22]]
"It wasn't like this restaurant had any major boasting points before, but now it's just disgusting.",[[4]]

"At that point, the waitress comes and asks us if everything's okay, I was literally so shocked that I was speechless and didn't say anything, and guess what, the waitress is gone.",[[4]]
"So I switched with my boyfriend again to see if I could make some meat and spinach again, but the spinach was so badly cooked that I just couldn't bite through it.",[[20]]
"It's really getting bad here: The manager said we can't do anything about it, it's a matter of taste that she didn't like it, and I can't make it up to her.",[[6]]

"However, I finished my plate, and that's when I found a worm in the mushroom sauce at the bottom.","[[14, 15]]"
I showed it to the manager and he apologized smiling and brought us two desserts for free (but he didn't ask us what we wanted and so he brought the last two desserts we would have ordered).,"[[5], [5]]"
"The manager finally said that it would comprise the two glasses of wine (which cost less than the meal), and made it seem like a big concession.",[[1]]
"I've worked in restaurants and cooked a lot, and there's no way a worm can get into a well-prepared meal.",[[19]]
"For a restaurant with a good reputation and that's usually so crowded, there was no reason for a lack of intelligent customer service.","[[2], [21, 22]]"

But $500 for a dinner for two that doesn't include wine?,"[[4, 5, 6]]"
"Look, the snacks were really good.",[[2]]
The entrance was also very good.,[[1]]

Desert is a mess.,[[3]]

I agree that dinner at Casa la Femme is like no other dinner experience!,"[[5, 6, 7]]"
I literally just got home from visiting Casa La Femme and I was so offended by my visit that I felt it was necessary to try to warn other diners who value their money and their time.,"[[7, 8, 9], [7, 8, 9]]"
We're late for our reservation so I can't complain too much about waiting for a table.,[[12]]

"""A lot of normal Indian food, but very well made.","[[2, 5], [2, 5]]"
"I got a 4 instead of 5 because of the price (only chicken tikka masala - no rice bread - is $25), which I would expect in a luxurious Indian restaurant but this place doesn't have a luxurious feel","[[33], [33], [12, 13, 14], [38]]"
"Also, the waiters try to push more food on you, like suggesting things as if they're honorable when they actually cost $$.",[[1]]
"But if you're willing to spend something and remember to ask if something they offer is free, then this is the place to go for Indian food.","[[25, 26], [21]]"
The lunch buffet is expensive but it's worth it.,"[[1, 2], [1, 2]]"

Bukhara is in my top 5 Indian places in New York,[[0]]
I've never been so disgusted with food and service.,"[[6], [8]]"
"However, once I received my mediocre predictable order of what Dokebi thinks happens as the Korean fair (sometimes you have to solve when it's your only option), I went through half my kimchi before finding a random piece of lettuce accompanied by a much more disgusting, sticky, clearly bad piece of fish skin.","[[32], [14, 16]]"
"My main concern was the health of the food they were sending to me and others, but I would be lying if I said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of 15, I expected at least a minimal effort from the restaurant to make things better.",[[8]]
"My girlfriend, being a little more aggressive, and having been equally disgusting making me throw the rest of her food away just as food called back just to be informed that she was probably wrong and that it was very likely an oyster, and that we were also on the blacklist of her restaurant.",[[19]]
"It wasn't like this restaurant had big points of bragging before the hand, but now it's just repulsive.",[[4]]

Too bad I had to pay two extra dollars for the stone bowl.,"[[11, 12]]"
The nakgi-bokum was horrible.,[[1]]
easily the worst fried squid I've ever tasted.,"[[3, 4]]"
The sauce tasted better at Chinese fast food than decent Korean.,[[1]]
"The side dishes were passing, and I got a filling on request.","[[1, 2], [1, 2]]"
The real problem I had with this place was the complete lack of service.,[[13]]
My wife had barely touched that dish disaster.,[[6]]
"The wife ate the risotto, which was amazing.",[[4]]
The farrow salad and the yucca potato puree were also extremely tasty.,"[[1, 2], [4, 5, 6]]"
I love the pizza Margarita I love the pizza from the east village,"[[11, 12, 8], [2, 3]]"
loving this place every time we're in town is one of the places we always go.,[[2]]
A slice of pizza from NYC.,"[[1, 2, 5, 3]]"
"The bark has a good bite and a good chewing, the sauce is light with a good acidity, the salt in the cheese is great, it really increases the flavor of all the other ingredients.","[[1], [11], [22]]"
"Personally, I like margarita pizza better, but they're all good.","[[3, 4]]"
Probably the most romantic restaurant in town.,[[4]]
"This is definitely my favorite modern Japanese brasserie (which doesn't serve sushi), and in my opinion, one of the most romantic restaurants in the city!","[[5, 6, 7], [5, 6, 7]]"
It's not just an adventure to get to this somewhat hidden place once you walk into the wooden doors without a zen mark and the intimate decor will make you feel like you're no longer in the city.,"[[11], [17, 18], [26]]"
"If you plan on coming here, make sure your date is someone you like, as you'll be taken to private cabins where there will be no people or food watching (choose the ones on the floor with glass roofs so you can see the stars in the sky!).","[[19, 20], [37, 38]]"
My party had the BBE $29 Fix Prix menu which was a wonderful deal since it also came with a sake flight!,"[[4, 5, 6, 7, 8], [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]]"
We start with a delicious sashimi amuse bouche,"[[5, 6, 7]]"
"I chose the black cod on the grill as my entry, which I absolutely devoured while someone commented that the grill salmon dish was better.","[[7, 3, 4], [20, 21, 22]]"
The sake has made a good compliment to the courses and is successfully introducing me to the sake world.,[[1]]
"For desserts, we tried frozen black sesame mousse (interesting but not extraordinary) and matcha (green tea in powder) and blueberry cheese cookie which was phenomenal.","[[4, 5, 6, 7], [13, 14, 14, 15, 18, 19, 20]]"
"Maybe it was the big company (I had friends visit me from Philadelphia) or the super reasonable price, but I can't say enough good things about this brewery","[[27], [27]]"
"I don't visit the same establishment more than once, or more than twice, but I'll come to Zenkichi anytime for a quiet, unhurried, memorable dinner.","[[17], [17]]"
"The service leaves much to be desired, from feeling rushed to the place of your order, to being ignored for the rest of the night.",[[1]]

"The price is high but the food is good, so I'd come back again.","[[6], [6]]"
This place doesn't make sense.,[[1]]
This place has totally strange decorative stairs that go up with m mirror walls I'm surprised how nobody's ever broken their head or fallen off the stairs-- mirror walls make you dizzy and delusional...,"[[5], [12, 13]]"
This place is not inviting and the food is totally weird.,"[[1], [7]]"

But I must say I'm surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant earlier this year.,[[12]]
"We'll be back, though, and we can't wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the yard.",[[18]]
The flatbush farm servants seem to have perfected that horrible technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for appointing you to attract their attention.,[[3]]
"A different server increased the fun, throwing our tickets in front of us halfway through our snack (which was delicious).","[[2], [16]]"
"Overall, the quality of the food was quite good, although I've heard that salmon is much better when it hasn't cooled down in front of the guest.",[[5]]
"The place has some good equipment some attractive furniture and, as far as I could tell, a reasonable wine list (they gave me the food menu when I ordered the wine list)","[[5], [8], [18, 19]]"
How is this mattress open?,[[3]]
Everything was fine until we got our meals.,[[7]]
I looked at the chicken and I was horrified.,[[4]]

"At this point, the waitress comes in and asks if everything was okay, I was literally so surprised that I was speechless and didn't say anything, and guess what, the waitress left.",[[4]]
"So I switched with my boyfriend again to see if I could take the meat and spinach again, but the spinach was so undercooked I couldn't bite it.",[[20]]
"This is where it really gets bad: the manager said, there's absolutely nothing we can do, it's a matter of taste that he didn't like, and I can't compose it.",[[8]]
"The manager came to the table and said we could do whatever we wanted, so we paid for what we enjoyed, the drinks and snacks and we went out.","[[1], [22], [24]]"
This staff must be fired.,[[1]]
It was a really good pizza.,[[5]]

If I could give you 0 stars I would for this place,[[11]]
"This place... God, where do I start?",[[1]]
It's a spectacular scene.,[[3]]
The decor seems to be the distraction so you won't realize you just paid $300 for a cold pineapple that took 2 hours to arrive!!!!,"[[1], [18], [18]]"
"How this place survives the competitive West Village market in this economy, or any other, is something I can't understand.",[[2]]
The big hot dogs,"[[2, 3]]"

But still... great place great food,"[[3], [5]]"
fabulous food - if the front staff doesn 't discourage you .,"[[1], [5, 4, 5, 6]]"

"Since the BFC doesn't take reservations, you almost always have to wait in the bar and be abused by front-house staff until you sit down, which can be more than an hour later!","[[2], [19, 19, 19, 20]]"
The retro frzzy girl (with winged glasses / lady Edna) will yell at you if you try to order a drink.,[[3]]
I'd be horrified if my staff rejected clients so early and so rude!,[[5]]
"There's another girl I can't describe, she's about 5'6"" brown hair, she listens to your conversation and listens to your rudder, except she only listens to the last part of what you said, so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and have nothing to do with what you're *really* talking about.",[[2]]

Take hot dogs to the next level,"[[1, 2]]"
"At first glance this place looks a little expensive for a hot dog restaurant, but in barking you don't just get your average hot dog","[[16], [23, 24]]"
Here the hot dog rises to the level of a real appetizer with numerous variations available.,"[[2, 3], [2, 3]]"
The atmosphere is great,[[1]]
I highly recommend fish tacos. Everything else was fine.,"[[3, 4]]"
The fresh air in the fireplace in the back really advertises it but needs a little more heat on a cold night.,"[[2], [5, 5]]"

"The pasta was well cooked, it didn't have enough sauce or flavor.","[[1], [1], [1]]"
The hostess was rude and I had a feeling they didn't want to serve us.,[[1]]
The only thing my friend left out was that when we sat down at the bar the bartender disappeared.,[[17]]
"I asked her for a menu, and the same waitress looked at me like I was crazy.",[[9]]
"I was surprised that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said, ""I can help you"" and ""How many are at your party?""",[[11]]
Shame on this place for the horrible rude staff and nonexistent customer service.,"[[8], [11, 12]]"
personal illness,[[1]]

The food is good.,[[1]]
The design of the space is good.,[[4]]
But the service is horrible!,[[2]]

The waiter delivered the food to us while holding in one hand what looked like a plastic garbage bag.,[[1]]
